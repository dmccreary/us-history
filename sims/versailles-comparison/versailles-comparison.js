    outcomeShort: 'League established, but secret talks preceded treaty',
    outcomeLong: 'The League of Nations Covenant was adopted as Part I of the treaty, but the major terms of the treaty itself were hammered out in closed-door meetings of the "Big Four" (Wilson, Lloyd George, Clemenceau, Orlando) at Paris.',
    why: 'Clemenceau and Lloyd George insisted on private bargaining to secure national interests. Wilson accepted secret negotiations to keep the conference moving.',

    outcomeShort: 'British naval supremacy preserved; clause omitted',
    outcomeLong: 'No freedom-of-the-seas provision was included in the final treaty. Britain refused even to discuss limits on its naval blockade powers.',
    why: 'Lloyd George viewed the Royal Navy and the right of blockade as Britain\'s decisive weapon in any future war and would not yield on the point.',

    outcomeShort: 'Treaty silent on trade; tariffs retained',
    outcomeLong: 'The treaty contained no general free-trade provisions. Within a few years the U.S. Fordney-McCumber (1922) and Smoot-Hawley (1930) tariffs raised barriers further.',
    why: 'European states wanted tariff protection to rebuild war-damaged industries; the U.S. Congress was strongly protectionist.',

    outcomeShort: 'Only Germany disarmed; great powers kept their forces',
    outcomeLong: 'Germany was capped at a 100,000-man army with no air force, tanks, or U-boats. France, Britain, and the U.S. faced no comparable limits in the treaty itself.',
    why: 'France demanded a permanently weak Germany. Britain and the U.S. were unwilling to disarm without binding security guarantees.',

    why: 'The Allies refused to recognize the Bolshevik government and hoped to reverse the 1917 revolution.',

    outcomeShort: 'Belgium restored; reparations awarded',
    outcomeLong: 'German troops withdrew, Belgian sovereignty was fully restored, and Belgium received reparations and the small districts of Eupen and Malmedy.',
    why: 'All Allied powers agreed on this point; Belgian neutrality had been the casus belli for Britain in 1914.',

    outcomeShort: 'Alsace-Lorraine returned to France',
    outcomeLong: 'Alsace-Lorraine, lost in 1871, was returned to France. The Saar coal basin was placed under French economic control for fifteen years, with a plebiscite to follow.',
    why: 'Restoring Alsace-Lorraine was a non-negotiable French war aim; Wilson endorsed it from the start.',

    outcomeLong: 'Italy received the South Tyrol, Trentino, Trieste, and Istria, but was denied Fiume and the Dalmatian coast that the secret 1915 Treaty of London had promised.',
    why: 'Wilson opposed claims that violated nationality lines; Italian PM Orlando walked out of the conference in protest.',

    outcomeShort: 'Empire dissolved; new states left large minorities',
    outcomeLong: 'Austria-Hungary broke apart into Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and parts of Yugoslavia, Poland, and Romania. Each new state contained substantial ethnic minorities.',
    why: 'Events outpaced Wilson: the empire collapsed in October 1918 before the conference convened. Border lines were drawn by Allied commissions with imperfect data.',

    outcomeShort: 'Yugoslavia created, but disputes continued',
    outcomeLong: 'Serbia, Montenegro, and former Habsburg South Slav lands were combined into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia). Romania gained Transylvania.',
    why: 'Allied support for Serbia and the South Slav National Council pushed unification. Border disputes with Italy, Bulgaria, and Hungary were settled by commissions, not plebiscites.',
    verdict: 'Yugoslavia held together until 1941, then again until 1991 — but ethnic tensions that the treaty left unresolved erupted in the 1990s Balkan wars.',

    outcomeShort: 'Empire partitioned; mandates established',
    outcomeLong: 'The Treaty of Sevres (1920) dismembered the Ottoman Empire into British and French mandates (Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon) and proposed Greek and Armenian zones. Turkish nationalists under Mustafa Kemal repudiated it; the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) replaced it.',
    why: 'Britain and France had pre-arranged the partition in the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916). Wilson\'s ideas of Arab and Armenian self-rule were brushed aside.',

    outcomeShort: 'Poland reestablished with the Danzig corridor',
    outcomeLong: 'Poland reappeared on the map after more than a century of partition. The "Polish Corridor" gave it access to the Baltic; Danzig (Gdansk) became a Free City under League supervision.',
    why: 'Polish independence had broad Allied support; the corridor was a compromise between giving Poland a port and avoiding outright annexation of a German-majority city.',
    verdict: 'Honored — but the corridor cut East Prussia off from Germany and became Hitler\'s pretext for invading Poland in 1939.',
    status: 'honored'

    pointText: 'A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.',
    outcomeShort: 'League of Nations created — U.S. Senate refused to join',
    outcomeLong: 'The Covenant of the League of Nations was Part I of the treaty. But the U.S. Senate, led by Henry Cabot Lodge, rejected ratification in 1919 and 1920. The U.S. never joined the institution Wilson designed.',
    why: 'Lodge\'s "reservationists" feared Article X (collective security) committed the U.S. to foreign wars without congressional consent. Wilson refused compromise. Both sides held firm.',
    verdict: 'U.S. absence weakened the League and helped enable the failures of the 1930s — Manchuria, Ethiopia, the Rhineland — that led to WWII.',

    outcomeShort: 'Germany forced to accept sole guilt for the war',
    outcomeLong: 'Article 231 of the treaty assigned Germany and her allies "responsibility for causing all the loss and damage" of the war, providing the legal basis for reparations later set at 132 billion gold marks.',
    why: 'France and Belgium demanded reparations to rebuild devastated regions; the war-guilt clause was the legal hook. Wilson agreed reluctantly to keep the treaty whole.',
